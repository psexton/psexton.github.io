<h2 class="intro">Hi. Iʼm Paul—a software developer living in Chicago, IL.</h2>

<p>TL;DR: Minnesotan transplant. Computer scientist. Reluctant runner.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Professionally</h2>

<p>I work for a research lab buried deep within the R&D division of a hearing aid manufacturer named&nbsp;<a href="http://gnresound-group.com/" title="">GN ReSound</a>, where a steady supply of problems to solve and expensive equipment to play with keep me occupied. I mostly utilize MATLAB and Java, but also occasionally maintain projects using Ruby and Arduino. After six years in this industry, as well as several years at government and academic labs, I've learned that scientists are pretty much the same everywhere. They all want to use MATLAB (or LabVIEW), they like LaTeX, and will stubbornly refuse to change their ways unless gently "persuaded". Which is why I keep a cricket bat near my desk.</p>

<p>Before moving to Chicago, I went to college at&nbsp;<a href="http://csbsju.edu/" title="">St. John's University</a>&nbsp;where I cut my teeth on C++ and graduated with a BA in Computer Science. Then I worked as a student intern for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/" title="">Sandia National Laboratories</a>. That summer job turned into a 4-year, ongoing project: writing linear algebra libraries for supercomputers. It also became the subject of my Master's thesis at the <a href="http://www.uic.edu/uic/">University of Illinois at Chicago</a>, and while I&nbsp;was slaving over a hot stew of MPI and templates, we even won&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rdmag.com/award-winners/2004/08/pearl-real-gem" title="">an award</a>&nbsp;for it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Personally</h2>
<p>I grew up just south of the Mississippi River in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. I can't actually say that the land of 10,000 lakes turned me into some kind of TED-talk-giving nature survivalist advocate. But the nerd that those Mississippi woods produced not only grew up to become a math master, he also became a lifeguard and (to this day) a backwoods, boundary waters enthusiast.</p>

<p>Mostly thanks to my sister Dakota, it is also now public knowledge that I <a href="http://monkeybicycle.net/your-humble-prairie-hometown/">buck a few other stereotypes as well.</a></p>

<h2>Where to find me</h2>
<p>Most of the code I write remains under guard by kittens with nerve and llamas with fight, but the parts that do leak out can be found at <a href="https://github.com/psexton" rel="me">Github</a> or at the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/authors/106467" rel="me">Mathworks File Exchange.</a> You can also find me at these fine establishments:</p>
