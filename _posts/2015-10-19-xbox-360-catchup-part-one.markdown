Here's a short summary so far:

- Assassin's Creed 1: Tedious and monotonous. I'm surprised this series got off the ground.
- Assassin's Creed 2: Surpasses AC1 is every possible regard. This is a great fun game, and Ezio is relatable.
- AC2 Brotherhood and AC2 Revelations: Also fun. I'm glad I only paid $20 for them and not $60 though.
- Assassin's Creed 3: A half-baked steaming shitpile.
- Assasin's Creed 4: Black Flag: Again, wonderful fun. Being a pirate is fun! What is it with this series and alternating back and forth?
- Batman Arkham Asylum: Great.
- Batman Arkham City: Also great. Expands on Asylum in new and fun ways.
- Batman Arkham Origins: Basically DLC for Arkham City, but in disc form. Nothing new here. Seriously nothing new.
- Grand Theft Auto 4: Incredibly improves over my GTA3 memories from the PS2.
- Grand Theft Auto 5: The sheer scale and scope of this game is mind-boggling. It appears uniquely detailed at a fine level. I cannot conceive of a map possibly getting bigger in GTA6.
- Red Dead Redemption: A more mature, more nuanced offering from Rockstar. The ethics are significantly grayer in this game.
- Hitman Absolution: I really love sneaky shooters, as a genre. A well-executed stealth execution makes me happy. But HA gets old quick. The storyline is fun. But the achievements of "now replay that same level, but without any costume changes" "now replay that same level, but with at least 3 costume changes" "not replay that same level, but with SLIGHT VARIATION #217" wore on me quickly.
