I think Pinterest is secretly a mechanical turk style service, run by an AI that is just curious about humanity.

It sends me pictures to look at, and ask me to categorize them.
Sometimes it asks me to look at other people's categorizations.
Sometimes it tell me that other people have agreed with my categorizations.
Whatever kinds of pictures I show an interest in, it send me more of those.
