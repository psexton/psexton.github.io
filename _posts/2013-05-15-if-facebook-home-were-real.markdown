description: A more accurate script for the recent Facebook Home ad.

You've probably seen this ad for Facebook Home. Curiously, I just took a business trip, tried to use Facebook Home while boarding, and my experience was a bit different:

## INTERIOR AIRPLANE CABIN - NIGHT
Paul walks down the aisle to row 34. Finding his seat, he reaches up to open the overhead bin to stow a bag. Rudely, he pauses in mid-gesture to look at his phone, which he has been holding this entire time, offscreen. As he opens the storage bin, a drunken man wearing a Chicago Blackhawks jersey is revealed to be lying there. The blaring of a stadium can be heard.

-> **SPORTS FAN**  
1 down, 3 to go! Go Hawks!!! <-

## PAN LEFT TO:

-> **SPORTS FAN #2**  
(shouting) LET'S GO HAWKS!!!<-

Another passenger closes this bin. We **PAN RIGHT** to show Paul closing his overhead bin, without placing any bags into it. Paul takes his aisle seat. He looks down at his phone, swiping from right to left. A tattooed redhead, clad only in a lacy thong, is taking a self-portrait with her cellphone.

## JUMP CUT TO:

The same woman pops out of the beverage cart that is inexplicably being wheeled down the aisle even though the plane is still boarding.

-> **PROMISCUOUS WOMAN**  
Like/Share For more! Hot Tattoos and Ethnic Fashion Lover! <-

Paul smiles, but then looks around the cabin, slightly embarrassed. Nobody seems to have taken notice. He swipes again. A puppy is shown.

## PAN UP TO REVEAL:
The 30 inches of legroom has expanded to 5 feet. A woman is standing there holding the dog.

-> **ANIMAL LOVER**  
Star is a very scared but sweet little schnauzer mix. Please come rescue this nugget.<-

Paul mouths "aww".

## PAN OVER HIS SHOULDER TO:
A well-dressed but mentally unstable woman is standing behind a podium, addressing a small crowd.

->**MICHELLE BACHMAN**  
They want to become the LensCrafter of big abortion in Illinois.<-

A flight stewardess touches Paul on the shoulder.

->**FLIGHT ATTENDANT**  
Sir, I need you to put that away now.<-

->**PAUL**  
Okay.<-

Paul lifts up his phone, and uninstalls the Facebook Home app.
