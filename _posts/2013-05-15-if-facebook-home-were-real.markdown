description: A more accurate script for the recent Facebook Home ad.
---

You've probably seen this ad for Facebook Home. Curiously, I just took a business trip, tried to use Facebook Home while boarding, and my experience was a bit different:

## INTERIOR AIRPLANE CABIN - NIGHT
Paul walks down the aisle to row 34. Finding his seat, he reaches up to open the overhead bin to stow a bag. Rudely, he pauses in mid-gesture to look at his phone, which he has been holding this entire time, offscreen. As he opens the storage bin, a drunken man wearing a Chicago Blackhawks jersey is revealed to be lying there. The blaring of a stadium can be heard.
<div class="script-dialogue"><p><strong>SPORTS FAN</strong><br /> 
1 down, 3 to go! Go Hawks!!!</p>
</div>

## PAN LEFT TO:

<div class="script-dialogue"><p><strong>SPORTS FAN #2</strong><br /> 
(shouting) LET'S GO HAWKS!!!
</p></div>

Another passenger closes this bin. We **PAN RIGHT** to show Paul closing his overhead bin, without placing any bags into it. Paul takes his aisle seat. He looks down at his phone, swiping from right to left. A tattooed redhead, clad only in a lacy thong, is taking a self-portrait with her cellphone.

## JUMP CUT TO:

The same woman pops out of the beverage cart that is inexplicably being wheeled down the aisle even though the plane is still boarding.  

<div class="script-dialogue"><p><strong>PROMISCUOUS WOMAN</strong><br />

Paul smiles, but then looks around the cabin, slightly embarrassed. Nobody seems to have taken notice. He swipes again. A puppy is shown.

## PAN UP TO REVEAL:
The 30 inches of legroom has expanded to 5 feet. A woman is standing there holding the dog.  

<div class="script-dialogue"><p><strong>ANIMAL LOVER</strong><br />
Star is a very scared but sweet little schnauzer mix. Please come rescue this nugget.</p></div>

Paul mouths "aww".

## PAN OVER HIS SHOULDER TO:
A well-dressed but mentally unstable woman is standing behind a podium, addressing a small crowd.  

<div class="script-dialogue"><p><strong>MICHELLE BACHMAN</strong><br />
They want to become the LensCrafter of big abortion in Illinois.</p></div>  

A flight stewardess touches Paul on the shoulder.

<div class="script-dialogue"><p><strong>FLIGHT ATTENDANT</strong><br />
Sir, I need you to put that away now.</p></div>

<div class="script-dialogue"><p><strong>PAUL</strong><br />
Okay.</p></div>

Paul lifts up his phone, and uninstalls the Facebook Home app.
