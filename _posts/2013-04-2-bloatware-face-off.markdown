description: Comparing the sources of unnecessary Android system applications.
---

I recently purchased a Nexus 4, fresh from Google Play. I was so happy to have a phone with just stock Android, free of all that crap Verizon Wireless preloaded on my previous Android phones. More importantly, free of crap that is annoyingly set as a system application so that I can never remove it without rooting the phone. Or so I thought. Some of that crap was actually from Google. And upon switching from Froyo to ICS/JB, I found new crap from Google. So here I'm going to document all the applications I don't need and don't want, from both phones. Let's see how it stacks up.

Some caveats: I do use and like [GMail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm), [GCal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar), [GMaps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps), and [GDocs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs). So even though those applications are also uninstallable, I'm not counting them as bloatware. I don't use [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store) for anything except apps, so something like [Google Music](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.music) or [Books](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.books) will count. Is this arbitrary? Yes. Do I care? No. (To be fair, I consider [the Newsstand app on my iPad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsstand_(application)) to be bloatware too. I'm not just hating on Google here. Although [iBooks](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8) is uninstallable, so +1 for Apple there.)

## The Incumbent
In this corner, a subsidized and locked HTC Incredible 2, purchased from Verizon Wireless. Running Android 2.3.4 (Froyo) with the HTC Sense 2.1 skin. Applications in the Apps list I don’t want:

## The Challenger
In the other corner, an unsubsidized and unlocked LG Nexus 4, purchased directly from Google Play. Running Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean). Applications in the Apps list I don't want:

- Currents (listed as [Google Currents](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.current) in Google Play "My Apps" list)
- Earth (listed as [Google Earth](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.earth] in Google Play "My Apps" list)

- Wallet (listed as [Google Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel) in Google Play "My Apps" list)

## The Verdict
Let's add that up:
- Unwanted Incredible 2 apps: 26
- Unwanted Nexus 4 apps: 11

So, less than half as much unwanted bloatware. But still not quite the lean and clean platform I was hoping for.
